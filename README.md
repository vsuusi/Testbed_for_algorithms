# Testped_for_algorithms
A menu driven test bed program for comparing searching and sorting algorithms.
Program features are divided into five groups; groups 1 and 2 involve searching algorithms and groups 3 â€“ 5 involve sorting algorithms.

The groups:

1) Sequential search from data given to it based on key value. The data size and key is given by user. Performance data is also output.

2) Binary search from data given to it based on key value. The data size and key is given by user. Performance data is also output. Group 2 also gives user an option to compare binary search to sequential search. Then program runs both searches 10 times with randomly generated key and user given data size, and prints out performance statistics for each search.

3) Insertion sort from data size given by user. User can also choose the number of items to be printed before and after sorting. All items can also be printed.

4) Quicksort from data size given by user. User can also choose the number of items to be printed before and after sorting. All items can also be printed.

5) Bubblesort, merge sort and comparision. User can choose two of four diffrent sorting methods, and compare them. Program prints out performance statistics for both algorithms.
